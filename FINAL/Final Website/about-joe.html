<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-187535a4-7fff-b2b0-582c-51b9afb4f79b">My name is Joseph Thompson, but I prefer to go by Joe. I am now entering my second year at UNM this upcoming fall and I plan to graduate with my bachelor&rsquo;s in spring. My major is Journalism and Mass Communications with a focus on multimedia journalism. I would like to work for the NFL as a sports commentator because I love watching and talking about football. If that doesn&rsquo;t work out, then I would like to write for a newspaper. </strong></p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-187535a4-7fff-b2b0-582c-51b9afb4f79b">If everything works out I will graduate with my bachelors in journalism in May 2024. After that, I would like to go somewhere else for my major, so that I can hopefully have better opportunities for a good job. I want to go straight into my masters because I would like to get it over with and not get distracted. </strong></p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-187535a4-7fff-b2b0-582c-51b9afb4f79b">Unrelated from school, I like to watch films and TV shows, which is where I got the idea to do some movie reviews for my Wordpress blog. I find it relaxing to go to the theater to watch new movies that I am interested in viewing. I like to go on runs because it feels relaxing and I also like to throw around/catch the football. I enjoy playing video games because they are fun to me. I really like listening to music all the time because it's soothing and it helps me focus. There are some more things I like to do when I am free from school work. </strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-187535a4-7fff-b2b0-582c-51b9afb4f79b">Contact me if you would like to know more or have any questions. </strong></p>
