<h1>CONTACT INFORMATION</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-427cc090-7fff-ca8d-7043-54f859f7e5a1">This is the internet, so I prefer not to give out personal contact information, but the email you can reach me at is<em> <a href="mailto:joeflacco@unm.edu">joeflacco@unm.edu</a></em>. I have developed a strong tendency to clear my notifications as soon as I can, so I check my email very frequently. This means I would respond very quickly to any email that I would receive. The contents of the email should be related to the website with any suggestions on how I can improve it for the better, questions regarding design choices or any questions at all about the site, constructive criticism, comments, and concerns. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I will not take suggestions or constructive criticism personally because I see this as a way I can improve my site for the better, so feel free to leave your thoughts, opinions, and feelings. If you leave suggestions or any constructive criticism, please let me know exactly how I could fix it, so there is no confusion on my end. I don&rsquo;t mind answering any questions at all regarding my website, so ask away! I will answer or explain as best as I can. </strong><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I also ask for you to please be specific on where you think something should be improved or changed. As in, tell me what page and section there is a concern on.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Once again, do not hesitate to reach out to me as I would like to hear what others have to say on how I could possibly make this overall website design better.</strong><strong></strong></p>
