<h1>HOME OVERVIEW</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-67383b1a-7fff-9886-4bfa-538f9024317e">Welcome to my Website, </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <strong id="docs-internal-guid-67383b1a-7fff-9886-4bfa-538f9024317e">On this website you can find the home page as you are on right now, some information on me, my education so far and plans for future education, a portfolio of some of the works that I have done for this class along with a link to my wordpress blog, and my information you can contact me at. The link to the other webpages can be accessed by clicking on the names above in the banner image or on the bottom of the page. </strong> <br>
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-67383b1a-7fff-9886-4bfa-538f9024317e">The main design element that is consistent on each webpage is the banner image I created myself. I decided to make a chevron pattern as a background for my banner image, and then I put a blue rectangle with opacity lowered. I typed my name and used the chevron pattern as the color of it. I then put a bevel &amp; emboss with brown color, and then I added a white stroke around it. That&rsquo;s how I got the effect I liked for my name. The &lsquo;Home, About, Education, Portfolio, and Contact&rsquo; text is a normal white text with a font I thought fitted well. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <strong id="docs-internal-guid-67383b1a-7fff-9886-4bfa-538f9024317e">Other design elements that I implemented are my resume and an image of me. I wanted to stay consistent with my design overall, so I added on that chevron pattern as a sort of frame around. I wanted to do something design wise, but I don&rsquo;t know how to do so YET. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <strong id="docs-internal-guid-67383b1a-7fff-9886-4bfa-538f9024317e">This personal website was created using Adobe Dreamweaver, and it was also created with the intent to showcase what I have learned so far from my web design class. This website should be pretty straightforward as I tried to make it easy on the eyes, so that the contents are not overwhelming. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <strong id="docs-internal-guid-67383b1a-7fff-9886-4bfa-538f9024317e">Please keep in mind that this is my first time experimenting and executing on creating a personal website, so feel free to leave any suggestions. Also, if there happens to be any other questions, comments, or concerns feel free to go to the contact link above or below that directs to my contact information. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <strong id="docs-internal-guid-67383b1a-7fff-9886-4bfa-538f9024317e">Thank you for viewing, </strong></p>
