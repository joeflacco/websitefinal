<h1>PORTFOLIO</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6aeaa78d-7fff-1cec-8b07-e7bd9ad7dfc3">Linked below are three of my assignments that I have completed for this class, and there is also a link to my Wordpress blog site. There are some descriptions of what the assignment was and how I found it helpful towards making this overall website. The description on the Wordpress blog will talk about what exactly the blog is about and how I was able to create it. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <em><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6aeaa78d-7fff-1cec-8b07-e7bd9ad7dfc3">file:///Users/flacco/Desktop/assignment.2/index.html </strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <strong id="docs-internal-guid-6aeaa78d-7fff-1cec-8b07-e7bd9ad7dfc3">This is the link for my assignment 2 work, which was titled: Assignment 2: Create an Introductory Webpage. I was able to make a simple webpage, which featured many of the elements I am using for making this website. From this assignment, I knew how to make the code text things, the header text on top, how to implement an image of my choosing, and the favorite thing I learned was how to change the background color for the website. </strong></p>
<p><em><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6aeaa78d-7fff-1cec-8b07-e7bd9ad7dfc3">file:///Users/flacco/Desktop/assignment4/index.html </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>This is the link for my assignment 4 work, which was titled: Assignment 4: Create a Header Using CSS. I had to put a header onto the document that was provided. I found this really helpful when making my personal website. After I created my banner image, I remembered this assignment and implemented it on my site. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <em><strong>file:///Users/flacco/Downloads/layout.html</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">  <strong id="docs-internal-guid-6aeaa78d-7fff-1cec-8b07-e7bd9ad7dfc3">This is the link for my assignment 6 work, which was titled: Assignment 6: Inserting and Formatting Images. I had to size the three images that were provided then I inserted those three images into the document that was provided. The three images were the header and two images that went with the text. I learned how to make the two text images float as well. This was helpful for my website because it showed me how to use images and how to size them to fit on the </strong><strong>page. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>https://wordpress.com/view/comm2245.wordpress.com</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>This is the link for my Wordpress blog, which is centered around film reviews. This blog will have a total of 11 posts. One will be an intro/review of two simillar blogs, and the other 10 will be film reviews. The films that I will review are as followed: Grudge Match (2013), The Accountant (2016), La La Land (2016), Interstellar (2014), Fight Club (1999), American Psycho (2000), Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), Amsterdam (2022), and Blade Runner 2049 (2017). I will review and rate these 10 films on an out of 10 basis. There will be a 2-4 paragraphs per review that goes into depth on these films. All of the reviews and rates of the films will be done solely by me. </strong></p>
